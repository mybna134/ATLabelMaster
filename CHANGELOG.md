# Changelog

All notable changes to ATLabelMaster will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added - LabelMaster V6
- Added LabelMaster V6 as the default label format, compatible with the 17-field YOLO Pose layout.
- Added per-keypoint `0/2` visibility editing; the controls are shown only for V6 and the reader remains compatible with `1`.
- Added `rm_label_tool.py` compatible 14/36-class parsing and dataset-level scheme detection.
- Added direct, non-converting V4/V6 opening and safe automatic legacy-format normalization.
- V5 and other visibility-aware inputs normalize to V6; inputs without visibility normalize to V4.
- Added strict line validation and atomic label replacement to prevent malformed imports from clearing labels.
- Added dataset-wide automatic format detection and removed manual input/output conversion controls.
- Added safe conflict rejection plus a title-bar `?` dialog describing every supported format.
